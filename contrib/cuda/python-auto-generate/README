With this new version, we will auto-generate:
  cuda_plugin.h cudaproxy.icu cudawrappers.icpp

In short, 'make' in this directory creates those files by calling:
  python cuda-wrappers.py main.template
Hence, cuda-wrappers.py and main.template are the important inputs for
auto-generation.

They are auto-generated in this python-auto-generate subdirectory.
We can then modify the main Makefile to copy those files into the plugin
directory and integrate them appropriately.

BUGS lists the current bugs to fix in the auto-generator.
Please continue to update it.

As of this writing, we still need to modify contrib/cuda2/Makefile
to call this Makefile in contrib/cuda2/python-auto-generate, and
then integrate those generated files with this code.
