See: http://www.drdobbs.com/parallel/unified-memory-in-cuda-6-a-brief-overvie/240169095
for an excellent discussion: "Unified Memory in CUDA 6: A Brief Overview"

For example, CUDA-4.0 (Unified Virtual Addressing) introduced
  'cudaMemcpyDefault' as an extra possible value of 'enum cudaMemcpyKind'
A single unified virtual address space meant that
  "The CUDA runtime could identify where the data was stored based on
   the value of the pointer. ... An immediate consequence is that the kind
   flag in the cudaMemcpy argument list becomes obsolete and is replaced
   by a generic cudaMemcpyDefault."

Note: Unified addressing is not yet supported on Windows Vista or Windows 7
   for devices that do not use the _TCC driver model_.
