1. Add log and replay logic for checkpoint-restart
   Most of the code is already exists; just need to integrate and test

2. Add explicit code for the state machine for UVM-shadow pages.
   The state machine has three states: RW, CUDACall, and RO.
   Direct transition from RW to RO should generate an assert/warning.

3. Add more test cases for different cuda calls; especially cudaMemcpy2d, cudaArray*

4. Add(?) and verify support for pinned memory
