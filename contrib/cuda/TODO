1. Add log and replay logic for checkpoint-restart
   Most of the code is already exists; just need to integrate and test

   + Done

2. Add explicit code for the state machine for UVM-shadow pages.
   The state machine has three states: RW, CUDACall, and RO.
   Direct transition from RW to RO should generate an assert/warning.

3. Add more test cases for different cuda calls; especially cudaMemcpy2d, cudaArray

4. Add(?) and verify support for pinned memory

5. Test Rodinia benchmarks

   + Done 11/25

6. Test HPGMG benchmark

   + Done

7. Test HPGMG with MPI

   + Done with up to 4 ranks

8. Test ckpt-restart for Rodinia

9. Add code for ckpt-restart of UVM

10. Test ckpt-restart of HPGMG

11. Fix Rodinia benchmarks for compilation on discovery

    + Done
